### Problem ###

Hey! You there!

Why not try to put in the flag?

## Hint ##
I'm pretty sure this is forensics...

## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Find the flag.

### Details ###

The flag can be found either by looking at the source of the problems page or by simply highlighting the text next to the description. It turns out that there is white text next to the description which reads: 
<br/>`A little bird told me the flag is sctf{those were some easy points}.`
