### Problem ###

I'm a made-up word, I sound like an astronomical term, and am also a Credit Union!

What word am I?

## Hint ##

**SUBMIT FLAG IN ALL LOWERCASE**

I am one of adunna's (Arun Dunna) many usernames!

**I used to play a game for a number of years, somehow I think this is related to one of the names I went by in it... Maybe there's some sort of database of all the players for that game? There could be some way to tie me to it?**


***You won't get the answer off of my Steam profile, try [this instead](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xlmatrix+csgo), and keep the first hint in mind.***

## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Figure out what adunna's username was for whatever game he mentions in the hints.

### Details ###

Following the link adunna provided in the hint revealed that he used to play [Warrock](http://en.warrock.nexoneu.com/), and in theory the problem can be solved by finding a database of Warrock players (probably from international tournaments since he mentioned participating in them) and looking for his username on there. However, I took a different approach.

I used this [Google search](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=credit+unions+with+strange+names) to find this [website](http://thefinancialbrand.com/26729/credit-union-name-change-study/) which compiled a list of credit unions who had made strange name changes. Just looking at the top of the list, `Solarity` sticks out as something that sounds like an astronomical term. Googling `solarity warrock` reveals that someone under that name has participated in ESL tournaments for the game, and it submits as the flag sucessfully!
