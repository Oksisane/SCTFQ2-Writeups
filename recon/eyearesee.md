### Problem ###

If I were to connect to `#sctfio` on `chat.freenode.net`, I might be able to find some interesting things, like people to talk to, admins to ask for help, and most importantly, the flag for this challenge.

## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Go to the IRC and get the flag.

### Details ###

Any IRC client can be used to solve this problem. The simplest way is to go to the [chat](http://compete.sctf.io/2015q2/chat.php) link from the main site and hitting the Start button. Once on the channel, looking at the topic reveals a strange bit of text: `flag{hanging_on_irc}`.

### Flag ###
