#### Writeup by GenericNickname

Created: 2015-12-08

### Problem ###


I made a writeup for HSF. The problem was called Cats, and I think it was worth 450 points.

## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Find Val's writeup and the flag in it.

### Details ###

A quick visit to the [about](http://sctf.io/about) page reveals that Val/V/nicebowlofsoup is Val Choung. A google search of `Val Choung Cats` leads to this [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlNqsDdGMo). 

Looking at the transcript of the video (which can be accessed under the More button under the video) reveals this text: `sctf{bet_y0u_cant_h4x_it!}`, which happens to be the flag!

### Flag ###

    sctf{bet_y0u_cant_h4x_it!}
