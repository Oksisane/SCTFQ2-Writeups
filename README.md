CTFs (Capture-the-Flag) are competitions where contestants must solve a series of challenges, each of which contains a flag (typically a hidden string of text). The challenges range from web exploits to reverse engineering to cryptography. sCTF is one such competition created by sCTF, an organization dedicated to creating and running CTF problems.

We are Steam Locomotive, a team of high school students from the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, TX](http://www.lasahighschool.org/). We are:
* Ehsan Asdar - [Oksisane](https://github.com/oksisane)
* John - [Jumboperson](https://github.com/jumboperson)
* Ashwin Gupta - [Shwinn](https://github.com/Shwinn)
* Michael Barre - [meeees](https://github.com/meeees)
* Neil Patil - [patil215](https://github.com/patil215)

During sCTF, we accumulated a total of 3030 points and finished in 2nd place.

Our goal is to maintain a comprehensive set of writeups for all the challenges within sCTF. It is a work in progress, so if we haven't posted a writeup  yet, don't worry! All will be added in the coming weeks.

If you found these writeups helpful, be sure to star the repository on ___!
